# FE-barbershop-booking

An app built for browsing, booking and paying for appointments with your local barber.

## Description

The app was built as a group project during the final phase of the Northcoders Software Development bootcamp which ran from October-22 to January-23. The goal was to build a fully-functioning software product using at least 2 new technologies that hadnâ€™t been taught on the Bootcamp. These were chosen as MongoDB for the back-end and React Native for the front-end

The project was phased over 3 weeks:

- Week 1 - idea generation, spiking and RATs, defining tasks on kanban board using Trello
- Week 2 - build the back-end using MongoDB. Start of the front-end build using React Native
- Week 3 - finalisation of the front-end

The front-end and back-end are in 2 separate repositories. The corresponding back-end repo can be accesed [here](https://github.com/g4ry5haw/BE-barbershop-booking).

The back-end incldues a hosted MongoDB Atlas database.

The API's are hosted on cyclic. You can check the server is up and running [here](https://rich-gold-basket-clam-cape.cyclic.app/api/health)
