# FE-barbershop-booking

An app built for browsing, booking and paying for appointments with your local barber.

## Description

The app was built as a group project during the final phase of the Northcoders Software Development bootcamp which ran from October-22 to January-23. The goal was to built a fully-functioning software product using at least 2 new technologies that hadnâ€™t been taught on the Bootcamp. These were chosen as MongoDB for the Back-end and React Native for the Front-end

The project ran over 3 weeks for the following phases :

- Week 1 - idea generation, spiking and RATs, task definition
- Week 2 - Back-end build using MongoDB. Start of Front-end design and build using React Native
- Week 3 - Front-end finalisation

The back-end is hosted

API's are hosted on cyclic. Check the server is up and running with the url :
